        "text": "Tihar, also known as Deepawali/Diwali and Yamapanchak, is a five-day-long Hindu festival celebrated primarily in Nepal and some parts of India. It is the festival of lights, as diyas are lit inside and outside the houses to illuminate at night. People make patterns on the floor of living rooms or courtyards using materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or flower petals outside their house, called Rangoli, which is meant to be a sacred welcoming area for the Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism, mainly Goddess Laxmi, the Goddess of wealth.\r\nTihar is the second biggest Nepali festival after Dashain and is usually allocated a three-day-long national holiday in Nepal. The festival is novel in that it shows reverence to not just elders and gods, but also to animals such as crows, dogs, and cows that have long lived in relationship with humans. \r\nThe fifth and last day of Tihar is called Bhai Tika It is observed by sisters applying tika or colourful marks to the foreheads of their brothers to ensure their long life and exchanges gifts to each other for keeping their brother-sister good relationships for their whole life.\r\n\r\nPeterborough Nepalese Society (PNS UK) is organising this year’s Community Deusi/ Bhailo programme on this occasion at Westwood hall in Peterborough. PNS has kindly requested to all community members and families to attend this fund raising programme and generously contribute to PNS for the charity works. PNS is, as before, highly optimistic in collecting a fair amount of fund for the good cause.",
